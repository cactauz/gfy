vram-low-high-quality-not-recommended=We detected that this computer has __1__ MB of video memory (VRAM). That is too low for the high quality sprites.

minimize-on-focus-loss=When running in borderless fullscreen, the game will minimize itself on focus loss, to make sure it doesn't cover your desktop when you want to switch to a different application.
max-threads=The number of threads used to render the game.
graphics-quality-label=The resolution of the sprites. Determines VRAM usage. Warning: 'High' resolution requires at least 3 GB of VRAM.
lights-quality=The rendering resolution of lights during the night. High values will greatly reduce performance.
show-smoke=Disable to increase performance on low-end video cards.
video-memory-usage-label=Determines how many sprites the game will try to put into sprite atlases. Creating larger sprite atlases reduces CPU usage due to the ability to batch draw calls, but may increase GPU load, because the GPU has to work with larger textures. Free floating sprites can be loaded into VRAM or kept in RAM (see Low VRAM mode setting).
texture-streaming=Sprites that were not put into any sprite atlas (see Video memory usage setting) will be kept in RAM until needed by the GPU.
texture-compression=Texture compression greatly increases number of sprites the game can fit to the video memory and speeds up rendering due to GPU having to transfer less data during shading. If you have old or integrated GPU, select low quality to reduce size of sprites even more to get extra performance.
sprite-atlas-size-label=Larger atlases improve draw call batching which reduces CPU load in rendering, but may be harder to handle for GPU.
high-quality-animations=If disabled, some animated or rotated objects (for example trains) will load only half of the normal count of animation or rotation frames. This greatly reduces VRAM usage.
full-color-depth=Rendering in only half (16-bit) color depth improves performance on low-end and integrated GPUs. This option has effect only on Windows 8+ or in OpenGL renderer.
render-in-native-resolution=On high-DPI screens (like Apple Retina) rendering in native resolution will produce higher quality image but may be very demanding on performance.
